        "Use of technical terms like 'SDK' and 'REST API endpoints' without immediate context or explanation for a non-technical audience.",
        "The phrase 'distributing the signups across multiple data centers helps us optimize our services by distributing the amount of data in each data center' is somewhat circular and unclear.",

        "Define technical terms like 'SDK' and 'REST API' upfront in simple terms (e.g., 'SDK: A small piece of software that helps your app talk to MoEngage').",
