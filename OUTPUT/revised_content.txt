## Delivery Types in MoEngage: Choosing the Right Channel for Your Message

MoEngage helps you connect with your audience in lots of different ways! This guide explains the different "delivery types" (also known as "orchestration types") you can use to send messages. Think of delivery types as the different ways you can *trigger* a message to be sent. This could be a one-time blast, a recurring campaign, or a message triggered by a specific customer action like abandoning their shopping cart.

Below is a breakdown of each delivery type MoEngage offers, along with the channels they support.

You can even use the "Best Time to Send" feature to optimize delivery based on when your users are most active. *Example: Announcing a flash sale.*                                                                                                 | Push, Email, SMS & RCS, Cards, WhatsApp, Facebook Audience, Google Ads Audience, Connectors, Connected Apps, In-app/On-site (with Event Triggered criteria)                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
